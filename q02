Explanation of Your Code (for Exam)
Hereâ€™s what the code in q02.py does, which you can write down if needed for your exam preparation:

Load the Data and Clean Column Names:

The code reads the CSV file and ensures that the column names don't have unnecessary spaces.
Filter VISA Transactions:

The code filters transactions where the cardType is "VISA", regardless of case.
Uppercase Shipping Country:

Ensures that all values in the shippingCountry column are uppercase to avoid issues with case-sensitive comparisons.
Group and Sum Transactions by Country:

Groups the transactions by country and sums the transactionAmountUSD for each country.
Limit to Top 20 Countries:

Filters the dataset to show only the top 20 countries by total transaction amount.
Create the Bar Chart:

Creates a horizontal bar chart (barh) showing the top 20 countries by VISA transaction amount.
Save and Show the Chart:

Saves the chart as mychart02.png and displays it.
