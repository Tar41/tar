Explanation of Your Code (for Exam Preparation)
Fetch Data from the API:

The code uses requests.get() to fetch product data from the provided API endpoint (https://fakestoreapi.com/products), which returns the data in JSON format.
Create a DataFrame:

The code converts the JSON data into a pandas DataFrame using pd.json_normalize(), which allows us to handle the nested structure of the JSON.
Filter Data:

Filters out products where the price is greater than or equal to 4,000 USD.
Plot a Histogram:

Creates a histogram of product prices with 10 bins, where each bar shows the count of products that fall within a certain price range.
Save and Display the Histogram:

The histogram is saved as hit04.png and displayed.
