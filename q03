Explanation of Your Code (for Exam Preparation)
Load the Data and Clean Column Names:

The CSV file is read, and the column names are cleaned up by removing unnecessary spaces.
Group by Card Type and Sum Transaction Amounts:

The code groups transactions by cardType and sums the values in the transactionAmountUSD column to calculate the total spending for each card type.
Plot the Total Spending:

The code generates a horizontal bar chart (barh) that shows the total spending by card type, sorted in descending order.
Save and Display the Chart:

The chart is saved as mychart03.png and displayed.
